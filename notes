issues: nav bar on profile redirect

TL v0.16 2/17
Added Spring, now can add fancy animations
Where to go from here:
1. learn DesignCode and understand how to make that app
2. prototype your app and think out the whole process
3. map mechanics, adding images, stacking and view, just general control
4. eta ??? Brief periods during week 8 and 9 I guess, get alot of work done in between school work.
