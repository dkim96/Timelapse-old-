# Timelapse-old-
Social Networking visualized with geolocationing.

Timelapse was a project I started back around 2015 during my sophomore year.

Currently this project is no longer executable because of the shutdown of Parse which was my server at the time
and because of the major changes from Swift 2 to Swift 3.

This code still has many useful functions and ideas that is still being used to update my new Timelapse file.
